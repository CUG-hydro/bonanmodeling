Matlab code for Climate Change and Terrestrial Ecosystem Modeling. Each
directory is named for a supplemental program. 

The directory sp_xx_yy contains code for supplemental program yy in Chapter xx.
The directory sp_02_01, for example, is the Matlab code for supplemental program
2.1 (Chapter 2, program 1). Each directory has a main Matlab program and may
have additional files called by that program. For example, sp_02_01.m is the
Matlab program for supplemental program 2.1 (there are no additional files). In
Matlab, type "sp_02_01" to run the program. All directories are similarly
structured, but may have additional files. Type "sp_xx_yy" to execute the
programs.
